            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Kris Aldrich. I was born in <span class="locationName">St. Petersburg, Florida</span> but have spent most of my childhood
                growing up in <span class="locationName">Defiance, Ohio</span>. I went to <span class="importantStuff">Miami University</span> out of high school, 
                where I got a bachelor's degree in <strong>Zoology</strong> and a master's degree in <strong>Environmental Science</strong>.
                After several years, I realized that academic work wasn't for me and I needed a change. 
                I am interested in computer engineering and networking and
                I am currently pursuing several degrees from 
                <span class="importantStuff">Northwest State Community College</span>. I've lived and traveled all over the 
                United States, from <span class="locationName">Baton Rouge, Louisiana</span> to <span class="locationName">Portland, Oregon</span> and everywhere in between.
            </p>

            <h3>Family</h3>
            <p>
                My family consists of:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Kris Aldrich <em>(me!)</em></li>
                <li>Catherine Aldrich <em>(my mother)</em></li>
                <li>Curt Aldrich <em>(my father)</em></li>
                <li>Kat Aldrich <em>(my sister)</em></li>
                <li>Earl Aldrich <em>(my brother)</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                My dad, Curt is from <span class="locationName">Defiance, Ohio</span> and my mom, Catherine, comes from <span class="locationName">Coldwater, Michigan</span>.
                I have two siblings, Earl and Kat. Earl works for MetaLINK in <span class="locationName">Defiance, Ohio</span> and Kat works in HR for 
                Google in <span class="locationName"> Austin, Texas</span>.
            </p>

            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>
                I have several <strong>hobbies</strong> that I enjoy in my free time:
            </p>
