            <p>
                My name is Kris Aldrich. I was born in <strong>St. Petersburg, Florida</strong> but have spent most of my childhood
                growing up in <strong>Defiance, Ohio</strong>. I went to <span class="importantStuff">Miami University</span> out of high school, 
                where I got a bachelor's degree in Zoology and a master's degree in Environmental Science.
                After working for several years, I realized that academic work wasn't for me and I needed a change.
                Currently I am working on several degrees from 
                <span class="importantStuff">Northwest State Community College</span> I've lived and traveled all over the 
                United States, from <strong>Baton Rouge, Louisiana</strong> to <strong>Portland, Oregon</strong> and everywhere in between.
